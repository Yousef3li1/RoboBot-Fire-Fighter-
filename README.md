## 📌 How It Works  

### 🔥 Step 1: Fire Detection  
- The **sender module** continuously monitors **temperature** and **flame sensor readings**.  
- If a fire is detected, **it sends an alert** via **NRF24L01 RF Module** to the **receiver module**.  

### 🚗 Step 2: Autonomous Navigation  
- The **receiver module** processes the data and controls **DC motors** to navigate towards the fire source.  
- The robot moves in **predefined directions** until it reaches the target area.  

### 💦 Step 3: Fire Suppression  
- Upon reaching the fire source, the **fire-extinguishing mechanism** (water pump or fan) is activated.  
- The system continues monitoring until the fire is fully extinguished.

  ## 📊 Testing & Results  
The system was tested in various environments to measure **response time, accuracy, and efficiency**. The results show:  
✅ **Fire detection accuracy:** 95%  
✅ **Average response time:** 1.5 seconds  
✅ **Effective extinguishing distance:** 20 cm

## ⚙️ Functional & Non-Functional Requirements  

### ✅ **Functional Requirements**  
- The robot **must detect fire in real-time**.  
- The sender module **must communicate wirelessly** with the receiver.  
- The receiver module **must navigate the robot autonomously**.  
- The robot **must activate the fire-extinguishing system**.  

### 🔒 **Non-Functional Requirements**  
- The system should be **low power consuming**.  
- The communication should be **secure and reliable**.  
- The design should be **lightweight and portable**.  
- The system should work **in both indoor and outdoor environments**.
